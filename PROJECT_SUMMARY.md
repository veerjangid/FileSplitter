## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Dual Interface Architecture
- **GUI Version**: Windows Forms application with intuitive interface
- **Console Version**: Command-line interface for automation
- **Version Selector**: Automatically prompts user to choose interface

### 2. Advanced File Processing
- **Memory Efficient**: Processes files line-by-line to handle large files
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking file I/O operations
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates and detailed logging
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery

### 3. Smart File Splitting
- **Keyword-Based Splitting**: Split files based on configurable keywords (default: M30)
- **Pattern Recognition**: Automatically detects program numbers (O followed by digits)
- **Smart Naming**: Output files named from program numbers (e.g., O00109181.nc)
- **Flexible Configuration**: Customizable patterns and settings

### 4. User-Friendly Features
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of user inputs
- **Auto-Suggestions**: Automatic output folder suggestions
- **Detailed Logging**: Timestamped logs with progress information
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient handling of multiple programs

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
```
Program.cs
├── Version Selector (GUI/Console/Exit)
├── FileSplitterProgram (Console Logic)
└── FileSplitterForm (GUI Logic)
```

### Key Components
1. **StreamReader**: Memory-efficient file reading
2. **StringBuilder**: Efficient string building for large content
3. **Regex Pattern Matching**: Program number detection
4. **Async/Await**: Non-blocking operations
5. **Windows Forms**: Modern GUI interface
6. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time user feedback

### Performance Optimizations
- Line-by-line processing for memory efficiency
- Async file operations for responsiveness
- Controlled concurrent file writing
- Progress updates every 10,000 lines

## Usage Instructions

### Quick Start
1. **Run Installation**: Double-click `install.bat`
2. **Launch GUI**: Double-click `run_gui.bat`
3. **Launch Console**: Double-click `run_console.bat`

### Development Setup
1. **Open Solution**: Open `FileSplitter.sln` in Visual Studio
2. **VS Code**: Use `.vscode` configurations for debugging
3. **Build**: Use `dotnet build` or Visual Studio

### Deployment
1. **Publish**: Run `publish.bat` to create distribution package
2. **Distribution**: Files in `publish/` folder ready for deployment

## Testing with Sample Data

The project includes `sample_ALL-PROG.TXT` which contains:
- 67 individual CNC programs
- 81,822 lines of code
- Program numbers from O00109181 to O00613021
- Various machine configurations and operations

### Expected Results
When processing the sample file with keyword "M30":
- Creates 67 individual .nc files
- Each file named after its program number
- Complete program from start to M30 command
- Proper formatting and structure maintained

## Configuration Options

The `config.json` file provides advanced configuration:
```json
{
  "DefaultSettings": {
    "SplitKeyword": "M30",
    "OutputFileExtension": ".nc",
    "ProgramNumberPattern": "^O(\\d+)",
    "AddEndOfLine": false
  }
}
```

## Build Information

### Requirements
- .NET 6.0 SDK or later
- Windows OS (for GUI version)
- Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code (for development)

### Build Status
- **Solution**: Complete and functional
- **Build**: Successful (with nullability warnings)
- **Testing**: Verified with sample data
- **Deployment**: Ready for distribution

## Development Notes

### Warnings Addressed
The build generates nullable reference type warnings, which are expected in C# 10+ with nullable reference types enabled. These warnings don't affect functionality but could be resolved for production use by:
1. Adding null checks
2. Using nullable reference types (?)
3. Initializing all fields properly

### Future Enhancements
1. **Configuration UI**: GUI for editing configuration
2. **Batch Processing**: Multiple file processing
3. **Custom Patterns**: Runtime pattern editing
4. **Export Options**: Multiple file formats
5. **Logging**: File-based logging system

## Support and Maintenance

### Common Issues
1. **Large Files**: Monitor memory usage with very large files
2. **Permissions**: Ensure write permissions for output folders
3. **File Encoding**: Default UTF-8 encoding may need adjustment

### Troubleshooting
1. Check logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify file format matches expected pattern
3. Ensure sufficient disk space
4. Run as administrator if permission issues occur

## Conclusion

The FileSplitter project provides a complete, professional solution for file splitting based on keywords. It combines ease of use with powerful features, making it suitable for both casual users and professional environments. The dual interface approach ensures accessibility while the robust architecture handles enterprise-level requirements.
